## Student Absentee Dashboard

Create a principal and guidance-counselor facing
dashboard from the provided dataset that assists in identifying students who are chronically
absent (missing X% or more of school days) for targeted interventions by guidance counselors
(e.g. parent conferences, SMS messages sent, phone calls home, etc).

    ● Displays a list of students who are chronically absent, including the data points from the
    data set you feel would be useful and relevant to view alongside each student.
    ● Allows the principal or guidance counselor to adjust the threshold for what it means to be
    chronically absent. Upon modifying the threshold, the list of students should change.
